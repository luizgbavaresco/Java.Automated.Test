# accenture.Test

Notes

Unfortunately, for some reason I could not run the test trought feature file, cucumber ins't working well on my machine, I hope it can work normally on your machine. However I built the entire test and it is working as expected, Please see the video "accenture.Test/Accenture Testing.mp4" where I show the test running.

I also created the test using IntelliJ, I hope you can import it into Eclipse without further problems.

If I made some mistakes, I will be glad if you let me know.
